One of the clearest signals of recovery came from restaurants, which added 15,000 jobs last month. The city’s full-service restaurants had three times as many employees last month as they had in April 2020, their lowest point. “For the restaurants, we have two very strong forces at work,” said Barbara Byrne Denham, senior economist at Oxford Economics. “Most of them are allowed to reopen, and many people are very eager to eat out.”
